# Cartwheel Lamp

More lighting for medieval atmosphere at feast and other events!

This is v1 of the hanging cartwheel lamp. I designed/made this after the PVC-mounted lamp.

# Instructions

1. LASER-cut the wood according to layouts in lamp.svg (or lamp-layer1.lbrn, lamp-layer2.lbrn, lamp-layer3.lbrn).
2. Glue layer 1 (bottom) and layer 2 (center) of the wood together.
3. Measure wire from lampholder slots in wood layer 2 to center of cartwheel, with some slack. Cut wire to this length (3 pieces).
4. Open the lampholders, discard the outer plastic shell. Only the inner mostly-metal part will be used.
5. Attach cut wire to lampholders. Place lampholders in slots in wood layer 2. Join wires in center of cartwheel using push-fit wire nuts. Ensure that the center terminal of all 3 lampholders are all joined to the same wire nut. You may want to hot glue the wire to keep it snug inside the slot in layer 2.
6. Glue layer 3 (top) of the wood on top of layers 1/2.
7. Add another layer of wood around each lampholder using the small circular pieces with hole pattern that matches the lampholder slot and surrounding airflow slots.
8. Place hot-glue around the outside top of each lampholder to ensure they're straight. This may be easiest with a lamp in the lampholder that can be used to vertically align (and hold in place) the lampholder while gluing.
9. Add another layer or two of wood to the center of the cartwheel using the larger circular rings.
10. Build the lid of the cartwheel center by gluing together the two large circular pieces with wire holes.
11. Cut a long wire which will stretch from the center of the lamp to the socket. Thread the wire through the lid. Attach the plug to one end. Attach the other end to the wire nuts inside the cartwheel center.
12. Build a wall around each lampholder using the small circular rings. IIRC, I added 6-7 layers to hide the entire lamp below the lit area.
13. Add another layer to the center of the cartwheel on the bottom; the larger circular piece with no hole.
14. Place eye rings at 3 equally spaces around the top of the cartwheel.
15. Thread string/rope through all 3 eye rings up to a central point above the cartwheel, which it will hang from. Use a carabiner at this hanging point to allow the cartwheel to be easily attached-to/detached-from the overhead stand.

FIXME: Document how to build the stand.
FIXME: Pictures to make this all easier to understand.
