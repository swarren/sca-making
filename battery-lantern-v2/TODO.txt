Fixes needed for v2a:

PCB:
- Silscreen on both sides of PCB, and both top and bottom of insert into LED holder.
- Tabs on side for LED holder to sit on and align easily.
- Spread connector holes to reduce possibility of bent wires bridging pins.
- Widen slightly to avoid hot glue getting in side holes.
- Spread copper pours over bottom of PCB.

LED holder:
- Redo wire routing cutout so it's more useful.
