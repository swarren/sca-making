# Instructions

1. LASER-cut the wood according to layouts in lamp.svg (or lamp-v2-layer1.lbrn, lamp-v2-layer2.lbrn, lamp-v2-layer3.lbrn).
2. Glue layer 1 (bottom) and layer 2 (center) of the wood together.
3. Cut the socket off the extension cord.
4. Measure wire from lampholder slots in wood layer 2 to center of cartwheel, with some slack. Cut wire to this length (3 pieces). Ensure you cut pieces from the loose end of the extension cord, not the end with the plug!
5. Open the lampholders, discard the outer plastic shell. Only the inner mostly-metal part will be used.
6. Attach cut wire to lampholders. Place lampholders in slots in wood layer 2. Join wires in center of cartwheel using push-fit wire nuts. Ensure that the center terminal of all 3 lampholders are all joined to the same wire nut.
7. Glue layer 3 (top) of the wood on top of layers 1/2.
8. Add another layer of wood around each lampholder using the small circular pieces with hole pattern that matches the lampholder slot and surrounding airflow slots.
10. Place hot-glue around the outside top of each lampholder to ensure they're straight. This may be easiest with a lamp in the lampholder that can be used to vertically align (and hold in place) the lampholder while gluing.
11. Add another layer or two of wood to the center of the cartwheel using the larger circular rings.
12. Build the lid of the cartwheel center by gluing together the two large circular pieces with no holes.
13. Build a wall around each lampholder using the small circular rings. IIRC, I added 6-7 layers to hide the entire lamp below the lit area.
14. Add another layer to the center of the cartwheel on the bottom; the larger circular piece with the small wire hole.
15. Drill a large hole in the PVC table cap top. Screw the PVC table cap to the bottom center of the cartwheel. Ensure it's perfectly centered on the cartwheel.
16. Thread the extension cord through the PVC table cap into the cartwheel center. Join it to the wire nuts, ensuring the live side is connected to the center terminal of the lampholders.
17. Cut the corners off the extension cord's plug so it can fit through the 1" pipe. This allows the pipe to be easily removed from the cartwheel for portability. This requires threading the wire through the pipe, or removing it later.
18. Thread the extension cord's plug into the top of the 5-way connector and out one side.
19. Plug all 1' pipes into the 5-way connector. This requires cutting out a short slot on one piece to thread the wire out.
20. Add the end-cap to each of the 1' pipes.
21. Stand up the constructed lamp, plug it in, and gaze upon it.
